🔧 Project Idea: "SkillSwap" – A Peer-to-Peer Skill Sharing Platform
📌 Overview:
SkillSwap is a platform where users can offer to teach a skill (e.g., guitar, coding, baking) and request to learn a skill from others. It’s like a social marketplace for time-based knowledge exchange — no money involved, just mutual growth.

💡 Key Features:
✅ User Authentication:
Register, Login, Logout

Profile pages with skills offered and wanted

✅ Skill Listings:
Post a skill you can teach

Post a skill you want to learn

Browse/filter listings by category, skill, location, time availability

✅ Matchmaking System:
Match users based on complementary skills (e.g., Alice can teach design and wants to learn Python; Bob can teach Python and wants to learn design)

Allow sending/receiving swap requests

✅ Messaging or Chat:
Built-in messaging between users to discuss meetups or virtual sessions

✅ Rating and Feedback:
After a session, users can rate each other and leave feedback

✅ Admin Panel:
Approve/ban users

Moderate skill listings or feedback
